In this example we are going to develop a jax container and set the configuration options compatible with our HPC system JURECA.

What is Containerization?

Containerization is a form of virtualization that packages an application with all its dependencies into a single unit (the container).
Unline Virtual Machines (VMs), containers share the host system's kernel (in this case, JURECA) and hence being these much faster to start, smaller in size and more efficient in resource usage.

Containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run (libraries, tools...).

Containerization is used for software development, deployment, microservices architecture, high-performance computing, data sciente, machine learning...
Benefits:
  1. Portability: You can run containers consistently accross different platforms (local, cloud or on-premises)
  2. Efficiency:
