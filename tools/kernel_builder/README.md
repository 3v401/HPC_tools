In this repository we will develop a basic Jupyter Notebook kernel for an HPC (High-Performance Computing) system. In this process we will define Kernel specifications, communication protocols, resource management and more.

Kernel Specification:

1. Define kernel.sh
2. Define kernel.json

Communication Protocol:

1. Jupyter's messaging protocol is ZMQ:
2. Ensure the kernel can communicate effectively with the Jupyter Notebook frontend

Environment Setup:

1. Configure HPC environment (modules, libraries, etc).
2. Ensure Jupyter Notebook server can access the HPC resources.
3. Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `ipykernel`).

Resource Management:

1. Handle job submissions and monitoring on the HPC cluster (using Slurm).
2.
